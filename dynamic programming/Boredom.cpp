				PROBLEM STATEMENT
Gary is bored and wants to play an interesting but tough game . So he figured out a new board game called "destroy the neighbours" . In this game there are N integers on a board. In one move, he can pick any integer x from the board and then all the integers with value x+1 or x-1 gets destroyed .This move will give him x points.
He plays the game until the board becomes empty . But as he want show this game to his friend Steven, he wants to learn techniques to maximise the points to show off . Can you help Gary in finding out the maximum points he receive grab from the game ?
Input Format :
Line 1 : Integer N 
Line 2 : A list of N integers
Output Format :
Maximum points Gary can recieve from the Game setup
Constraints :
1<=N<=10^5
1<=A[i]<=1000
Sample Input :
2
1 2
Sample Output :
2
